## Introduction

This repository was created to host and store essential files — such as slides (for useful reference), source code, and more — for the Balloon Satellite Programme in one, accessible location.

## Structure of repository

The project is split into a structure as shown:

```
├── Slides (symlink)
├── Supporting Files
├── src 
```

`Slides`, as the name suggests, include the lesson materials (slides) for each lesson. `Supporting Files` refers to miscellaneous files that are secondary but has some use concerning the project. The `src` (source) folder contains all the source code for the Arduino boards to run and other miscellaneous code.

## Contributions

This project is mostly for educational purposes only, and not for general purposes. We are not accepting contributions; this repository is only up for the preservation of the source code written during the programme.
