## Introduction

This repository was created to host and store essential files — such as slides (for useful reference), source code, and more — in one, accessible location. Please feel free to store as many things **related to the programme**; it doesn't only need to be code-only files.

## Structure of repository

The project is split into a structure as shown:

```
├── Slides
├── Supporting Files
├── src 
```

`Slides`, as the name suggests, include the lesson materials (slides) for each lesson. `Supporting Files` refers to miscellaneous files that are secondary but has some use concerning the project. The `src` (source) folder contains all the source code for the Arduino boards to run.
